### Header

The header section, as per the problem statement, has a height of 100px and includes a navbar along with the website logo. This section is fully responsive; in mobile size, navbar links are hidden, and a hamburger menu icon is added. HTML tags such as section, header, and nav have been used to enhance on-page SEO.

### Hero Section

The hero section takes up all available height after the header and a 100px footer. It features an image of Travelopia, with added color using the HTML pseudo-element "before." The hero section also contains a details section with a title and a button for opening a popup. Clicking the button adds a centered popup to the webpage, changing the background color. The popup includes the text "Hello, world" and a closing button; clicking the close button removes the popup.

### Footer

As outlined in the problem statement, the footer section has a height of 100px, containing basic details like the address and copyright information of the webpage. This section is also fully responsive.

I hope you enjoy navigating through the Travelopia Frontend Assignment! Feel free to provide feedback and suggestions for further improvement.
